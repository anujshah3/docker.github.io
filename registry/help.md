If you need help, or just want to chat, you can reach us we have a #distribution channel in the CNCF Slack that everyone is welcome to join and chat about development.

If you want to report a bug:

- be sure to first read about [how to contribute](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- you can then do so on the [GitHub project bugtracker](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/issues).

You can also find out more about the Docker's project [Getting Help resources](../opensource/ways.md).
